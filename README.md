## 📂 File Structure

```
login-form-Appl/
│
├── index.html        # Main HTML structure
├── style.css         # External CSS styles (can also be embedded)
└── script.js         # JavaScript for UI interaction
```

> Note: In this version, the CSS is included inline for simplicity. For production use, it's recommended to separate it into its own `style.css` file.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. The default view shows the **Sign In** form.
2. Click **"Sign Up"** to reveal the **Sign Up** form using a smooth overlay transition.
3. Click **"Sign In"** to return to the login form.
4. Both forms are wrapped in a dynamic container that toggles CSS classes for animation.

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- 🖥️ Currently optimized for **desktop only**
- 📡 No backend or database integration (form actions are placeholders)
- 🔐 Social login buttons are UI-only (non-functional)
